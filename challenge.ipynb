Bell Canada has really put their money where their hastag is, they have created resources that help businesses of all sizes not only understand the financial impact of mental illness on the bottom line, but give practical tools to businesses, teachers, students and anyone willing to learn just a little to help end the stigma of mental illness, and commit a little bit to improving the mental health of anyone they interact with.

Serving Durham Region, and Greater Toronto Area. We style your home to sell quicker and for more money! Additional Information Bidding wars will happen when potential buyers feel emotionally connected to a home...regardless of the market conditions. The listing that WOWs buyers, will m...otivate them to make the purchase, and the best way to create that \\u201cWOW!\\u201d feeling is with home staging. Typically, the staged house will sell for a much higher price, and 90% faster than the one that is not staged. What can be more disappointing than not getting full value for your home?! By investing up to 3% of the asking price in home improvements + staging, sellers typically get back their money... oftentimes, much more! This prep-work will take away the stress of having your house sit on the market for weeks or months at a time, resulting in lost momentum and money. Think about it... the possibility of carrying two mortgages, having little or no buyer interest, receiving low-ball bids... all causing unnecessary stress. A professional home stager will help you with: choosing appropriate paint/flooring/decor colours, editing/rearranging furniture, adding/removing necessary items, and in our case, pre-styling for those all-important online photos. Give us a call... we'd love to hear from you and work with you! Phone messages will be returned within 24 hrs.  Products Services include: Consultations (for selling or dwelling), Redesign, Personal Shopping (includes designer discounts), Occupied and Vacant Home Staging, Rentals, Pre-Photographer Styling, Decorating for the Holidays.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"email\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19745,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"info@whiteboxdesign.com\",\n          \"office@financialworks.ca\",\n          \"info@forbesmanhattan.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71167,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"http://londoncurling.ca\",\n          \"https://spud.org.uk\",\n          \"https://atlanticnailsupply.ca\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 70999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lifespan - A Health System\",\n          \"Douglas Driveway Services Inc\",\n          \"Saint Matthew Coptic Charity \\u062c\\u0645\\u0639\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u062f\\u064a\\u0633 \\u0645\\u062a\\u0649 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062e\\u064a\\u0631\\u064a\\u0629\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"page_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Person\",\n          \"Restaurant\",\n          \"LocalBusiness\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"phone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44306,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"+15146058200\",\n          17802070720.0,\n          14034374498.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"phone_country_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hr\",\n          \"il\",\n          \"cl\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"region_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 434,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hi\",\n          \"up\",\n          \"ara\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"region_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"abruzzo\",\n          \"sakarya\",\n          \"attica\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"zip_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25958,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"t1a 0c6 t1a 0c6\",\n          \"97828\",\n          \"j2s 5j1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I wasn't sure how to get on this band wagon in a way that felt authentic. So, I wrote a blog cause that is who I am. Bell Canada has really put their money where their hastag is, they have created resources that help businesses of all sizes not only understand the financial impact of mental illness on the bottom line, but give practical tools to businesses, teachers, students and anyone willing to learn just a little to help end the stigma of mental illness, and commit a little bit to improving the mental health of anyone they interact with.

Serving Durham Region, and Greater Toronto Area. We style your home to sell quicker and for more money! Additional Information Bidding wars will happen when potential buyers feel emotionally connected to a home...regardless of the market conditions. The listing that WOWs buyers, will m...otivate them to make the purchase, and the best way to create that \\u201cWOW!\\u201d feeling is with home staging. Typically, the staged house will sell for a much higher price, and 90% faster than the one that is not staged. What can be more disappointing than not getting full value for your home?! By investing up to 3% of the asking price in home improvements + staging, sellers typically get back their money... oftentimes, much more! This prep-work will take away the stress of having your house sit on the market for weeks or months at a time, resulting in lost momentum and money. Think about it... the possibility of carrying two mortgages, having little or no buyer interest, receiving low-ball bids... all causing unnecessary stress. A professional home stager will help you with: choosing appropriate paint/flooring/decor colours, editing/rearranging furniture, adding/removing necessary items, and in our case, pre-styling for those all-important online photos. Give us a call... we'd love to hear from you and work with you! Phone messages will be returned within 24 hrs.  Products Services include: Consultations (for selling or dwelling), Redesign, Personal Shopping (includes designer discounts), Occupied and Vacant Home Staging, Rentals, Pre-Photographer Styling, Decorating for the Holidays.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"email\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19745,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"info@whiteboxdesign.com\",\n          \"office@financialworks.ca\",\n          \"info@forbesmanhattan.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71167,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"http://londoncurling.ca\",\n          \"https://spud.org.uk\",\n          \"https://atlanticnailsupply.ca\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 70999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lifespan - A Health System\",\n          \"Douglas Driveway Services Inc\",\n          \"Saint Matthew Coptic Charity \\u062c\\u0645\\u0639\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u062f\\u064a\\u0633 \\u0645\\u062a\\u0649 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062e\\u064a\\u0631\\u064a\\u0629\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"page_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Person\",\n          \"Restaurant\",\n          \"LocalBusiness\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"phone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44306,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"+15146058200\",\n          17802070720.0,\n          14034374498.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"phone_country_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hr\",\n          \"il\",\n          \"cl\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"region_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 434,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hi\",\n          \"up\",\n          \"ara\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"region_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"abruzzo\",\n          \"sakarya\",\n          \"attica\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"zip_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25958,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"t1a 0c6 t1a 0c6\",\n          \"97828\",\n          \"j2s 5j1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Bell Canada has really put their money where their hastag is, they have created resources that help businesses of all sizes not only understand the financial impact of mental illness on the bottom line, but give practical tools to businesses, teachers, students and anyone willing to learn just a little to help end the stigma of mental illness, and commit a little bit to improving the mental health of anyone they interact with.

Serving Durham Region, and Greater Toronto Area. We style your home to sell quicker and for more money! Additional Information Bidding wars will happen when potential buyers feel emotionally connected to a home...regardless of the market conditions. The listing that WOWs buyers, will m...otivate them to make the purchase, and the best way to create that \\u201cWOW!\\u201d feeling is with home staging. Typically, the staged house will sell for a much higher price, and 90% faster than the one that is not staged. What can be more disappointing than not getting full value for your home?! By investing up to 3% of the asking price in home improvements + staging, sellers typically get back their money... oftentimes, much more! This prep-work will take away the stress of having your house sit on the market for weeks or months at a time, resulting in lost momentum and money. Think about it... the possibility of carrying two mortgages, having little or no buyer interest, receiving low-ball bids... all causing unnecessary stress. A professional home stager will help you with: choosing appropriate paint/flooring/decor colours, editing/rearranging furniture, adding/removing necessary items, and in our case, pre-styling for those all-important online photos. Give us a call... we'd love to hear from you and work with you! Phone messages will be returned within 24 hrs.  Products Services include: Consultations (for selling or dwelling), Redesign, Personal Shopping (includes designer discounts), Occupied and Vacant Home Staging, Rentals, Pre-Photographer Styling, Decorating for the Holidays.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"email\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19745,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"info@whiteboxdesign.com\",\n          \"office@financialworks.ca\",\n          \"info@forbesmanhattan.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71167,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"http://londoncurling.ca\",\n          \"https://spud.org.uk\",\n          \"https://atlanticnailsupply.ca\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 70999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lifespan - A Health System\",\n          \"Douglas Driveway Services Inc\",\n          \"Saint Matthew Coptic Charity \\u062c\\u0645\\u0639\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u062f\\u064a\\u0633 \\u0645\\u062a\\u0649 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062e\\u064a\\u0631\\u064a\\u0629\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"page_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Person\",\n          \"Restaurant\",\n          \"LocalBusiness\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"phone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44272,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"+19052320221\",\n          \"+18002431455\",\n          \"+15733558724\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"phone_country_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hr\",\n          \"il\",\n          \"cl\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"region_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 434,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hi\",\n          \"up\",\n          \"ara\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"region_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"abruzzo\",\n          \"sakarya\",\n          \"attica\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"zip_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25958,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"t1a 0c6 t1a 0c6\",\n          \"97828\",\n          \"j2s 5j1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
